ArrayCalculator
===========================

This is just a for-fun project. Hopefully it can help others figure out how to handle this problem. The goal here is
to add two arrays together based on their integers. No converting to strings or modifying the array order. The downside
to doing this in Objective-C is the verbose object creation to store the ints in an NSArray.
